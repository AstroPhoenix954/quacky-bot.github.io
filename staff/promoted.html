    <h2>Your Job</h2>
    <p>As a moderator, your job is to find Chat Offenders, assist Helpers in Moderation, and Manage Reports.</p>
    <p>Remember that as a Moderator you are representing the Quacky Bot Staff Team.</p>
    <h2>Your New Permissions</h2>
    <p>As a moderator, you have been granted the following new permissions:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Access to the Message Logs.</li>
      <li>Permission to Kick Users.</li>
      <li>Permission to Mute Users.</li>
      <li>Permission to View User Reports.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Managing Reports and Support Tickets</h2>
    <p>As a moderator, you get access to Support Tickets and Reports.</p>
    <p><a href="tickets.html">Click Here to Read on how to Manage Support Tickets</a></p>
    <p>To manage reports, you will need solid evidence to take moderation actions on a user.</p>
    <p>If a report relates to an action in the chat you will need to use your judgement in order to take/not take moderation actions on the user.</p>
    <p>If a report is related to DM Advertising ask for a screenshot of the user's mutual servers in order to prove that the message was not faked.</p>
    <p>If the user cannot show the mutual servers mention an admin to take over the ticket. If they can, take moderation actions on the user.</p>
    <h2>Anyway...</h2>
